, π and of course,
the answer to life, the universe and everything, 42, are known as the real numbers.
Conventionally, we denote the family of all numbers as R.
But, sometimes, real numbers aren’t sufficient. Below is an example that might be all
too familiar.
EXAMPLE 1.1: Recall that the solution to any quadratic equation of the form
ax2 +bx+c = 0, is given by:
x =
−b±
√
b
2 −4ac
2a
If we try to solve the quadratic equation x
2 +5x+10 = 0 for x, we’ll get:
x =
−5±
√
25−4 · 10
2
=
−5±
√
−15
2
What’s the value for √
−15? In other words, is there a real number a such that a
2 =
−15? It’s not hard to convince yourself that, in fact, no real numbers, being positive
or negative, can satisfy this condition.
Should we just give up? Of course not! We’re doing mathematics: if something
doesn’t exist, we invent it! This is where complex numbers come in. If you pursue
your studies in virtually any field of science and/or engineering, chances are complex
numbers will become your best friends. They have many applications in physics,
chemistry, biology, electrical engineering, statistics, and even finance and economics.
As you’ll learn soon enough, in quantum mechanics, complex numbers are
absolutely everywhere.
1.1 What is a complex number?
In some sense, we’ve already defined what a complex number is. In the example
above, since √
−15 is not real, then x is certainly not real either. (Adding a real
number with a non-real number cannot give you something real!) So by definition,
we’ll call numbers like this complex numbers.
But of course, being mathematicians-in-training, we’d like to have something more
concrete, better defined. Looking at x again, all the kerfuffle seems to be caused by
the nasty minus sign under the square root. Let’s take care of that.
